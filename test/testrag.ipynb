Here are some essential safety tips to keep in mind:\\n\\nBefore you go, research the local customs, laws, and potential safety issues in the areas you plan to visit.

      "Conductor on a provincial bus in PangasinanBuses in the Philippines are mostly manned by two persons, a driver and a conductor. The conductor also announces stops and assists passengers, aside from punching tickets and collecting fares. Due to the distances involved, buses running long-haul runs (e.g. Manila to Bicol, or Manila to Davao) are required to have a second driver who takes over the wheel after six hours of driving. In luxury buses, there will also be bus attendants or stewards, which will greet you, serve you snacks and meals, and provide blankets for the rest of the journey. Bus staff in the Philippines are very helpful, but unlike airline staff, are less used to foreigners.Many buses on scheduled service prominently display the destination, as well as the key intermediate stops and (on some companies) service pattern on the windshield, usually on hand-painted signs handled by the conductor. Some companies already use digital signage for the destination. The class of the bus is generally posted at the top right of the windshield. In Manila and Cebu City, which have numbered routes, city buses may display the route number on a sign pasted above the windshield or on a scrolling digital destination sign. You can also find out whether a bus has onboard WiFi, TV or restrooms through signs on the windshield.. Bus travel in the Philippines is often unsafe, especially with provincial buses. Buses do get involved in a lot of accidents, from simple head-on or rear-end crashes with other traffic, to vehicles running off cliffs on mountain roads. Some advice are: Ask locals or for what are the safer operators of a certain route. Avoid taking ordinary buses unless there is no alternative. Most are crowded and overloaded, and the vehicle may be dilapidated.  Think twice before taking overnight buses, as they do get involved in many deadly crashes. Buses on overnight routes may not have a second driver, and the driver may have taken up drugs to keep themselves awake. Stick to reputable bus companies, or book a flight instead.Crimes on buses is uncommon on provincial routes, but more so in city buses and medium-distance provincial routes, where standing passengers are normal. Pickpocketing is the most common crime aboard buses, but distraction theft also happen.Beware also of scams at large bus stations. One common scam involves fake porters, which will bring you to overpriced shops or restaurants.Buses have been the target of some terrorist incidents in the 2000s. In the wilder parts of Mindanao, buses may get bombed by terrorists or attacked by bandits, so, passengers can only board at designated stops or stations, and luggage may be inspected by transportation police.\n",

National Highways are better, but they are still narrow, and Indian driving discipline is non-existent. In the past few years, the central government has embarked on an ambitious project to upgrade the highways. The Golden Quadrilateral connecting the four largest cities of Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata with four-laned highways has been completed and is of a reasonable standard. Some of it is of an international standard, but that cannot be said for all of it. However, improving the quality of the roads does not improve how people drive. It is very dangerous to drive on the roads in India, as people drive as they like without regard to any rules and the existing rules go unenforced..  The emergency number for India is 112.India is one of the deadliest countries when it comes to driving. Traffic collisions in India are a major source of deaths, injuries and property damage every year. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2021 report states that there were 155,622 fatalities, highest since 2014, out of which 69,240 deaths were due to two-wheelers. A study by Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, U.S. shows that the use of seat belts significantly reduces the risks and injuries from road accidents, and yet there is no enforcement on use of seat belts in cars. A study by IIT Delhi points out that the national highways constitute only 2% of the length of roads in India, but they account for 30.3% of total road accidents and 36% of deaths. Thus, it is best to avoid driving in major cities.A marriage party, minister or religious processions are regular and can hold up traffic. Weddings and religious processions are common occurrences in India. Thus, do not be shy in seeking an alternate route like driving an unpaved road to skip traffic.While driving on wide roads, be alert. Wrong-way driving (WWD) is a big problem in India.India has been ranked fourth among the countries with the worst drivers as of 2023, so please be careful on what you are doing when driving.Car culture also contributes to air pollution in India, as cars typically use diesel fuels.\n",

      "Spanish- some indigenous people, particularly women, may not speak Spanish. Kakchiqu'el- the indigenous language spoken in this area (several languages are spoken around Lake Atitlán). All buses arrive at Central Park.From Guatemala City:Direct buses available. Take a bus to Sololá. Or, take a bus to Panajachel and get off 10 minutes prior to reaching Pana, since the bus drives through Sololá. You can get on this bus at the main bus depot or wait for it to come at the bus stop across from Tikal Futura.1 transfer bus- take any bus toward the Western Highlands (e.g. Xela) and get off at Los Encuentros (approximately 2.5 hours, Q40 in July 2024). This is a fork in the road with terrible toilets and a lot of greasy food stalls. Generally a bus to Sololá or Panajachel is waiting, and departs every 20 minutes or when enough people are on it. From here, it takes approximately 20 minutes to arrive in Sololá, and cost Q5 as of July 2024.From Antigua:Since both Antigua and Pana are major destinations, it is best to get on the bus at the bus depot to ensure you get a seat. The ride takes approximately 3 hours.From Panajachel:Bus- approximately 10 minutes (Q5 in July 2024)Pick-up- approximately 7 minutes. Cemetery with amazing view of Lake Atitlán. Hike from Sololá to Panajachel.Take a pick-up to a more remote village and hike for the day. Ask about return times in advance, since some pick-up routes run on a limited schedule. There are few to no hotels in the villages. It is possible to hike to (one of the villages on the lake) which does have a hotel.Enjoy Central Park in the evening, when the music is playing through the speakers and the fountains' water is lit with colored lightsVisit Universidad del Valle and walk on the nature trail. Learn about the agricultural practices; birding. Take the bus from Sololá's Central Park and ask for \"Universidad del Valle\". It takes about 10 minutes and costs 2Q (2004). Try to get a spot on the bus near a door, since it is one of the earlier stops. This might be easier if you enter from the back door and sit in a back seat. Then you can also exit via the back door.. Flowers- an amazing selection of flowers are available at the Sunday (?) market. Arrive early in the morning for the best selection.Textiles- since each town has its own colors and patterns for textiles, travel directly to Solola if you desire the red stripes worn by women or the black and white wool worn by men.Tofu- the tofu factory is not open to the public. It supplies tofu for all of Panajachel's restaurants, and is also sold in the tofu store in Sololá along with soy ice cream. Sololá's tofu store is near Central Park. From the northwest corner of  Central Park walk north. It is on the right-hand side approximately 2 blocks away.. Food stalls: wonderful soups and dishes of meat, beans, and rice with fresh handmade corn tortillas.Food stands:Fried chicken and french fries. Watch for a few minutes to wait for a fresh batch to come out of the fryerTacos with fried onionsChurros are more prevalent during the annual feriaCorn on the cob- ask to have it the same as the person in front of you, with ketchup and mayonnaise or salt and lemonBakeriesVarious for bread, cakes, and dessertsTortillerias. This is not a tourist town, so mainly men go to bars. Women do not tend to frequent bars, although they may drink at home among their family.. Various small, clean hotels. Mainly cater to the traveling salesmen. Prices similar to those in Panajachel.. Lake Atitlán\n",

      "With a city population of 137,000, and 360,000 in the agglomeration (2020), Tours is the largest city in Centre-Val de Loire, though the status of regional capital is held by Orléans. Tours sits on both the river Loire and on its large tributary the Cher, with the city centre located between the two. The city has a number of attractions, including two cathedrals, a number of interesting museums and great local cuisine. Furthermore, Tours is excellently placed to serve as a base from which to explore the countless châteaux of the Loire Valley. The administrative department of Indre-et-Loire, of which Tours is the prefecture, is known almost exclusively to residents by its much older name of the Touraine, and is renowned for its wines and for the supposed perfection of its local spoken French.. Façade of the Cathedral.  Cycle, walk or jog along the Loire: Starting at Pont Wilson, on either bank of the river, you can walk or cycle for many miles up- or down-stream. Visit La Gloriette , a public park south-west of the centre with an experimental vegetable garden and an adventure park, high in the trees. For Free!. Place Plumereau and Rue Colbert are arguably the best two places to eat in Tours. Rue Colbert has cuisines from all over the world including Iranian, Turkish, Arab, Japanese, previous French colonies and Italian..  L'Academie de la Biere Bar at the end of Rue Colbert with about 200 types of beer, along with a tiny dance area. Place Plumereau There are lots of places to drink in the old town around Place Plumereau. Many people go to the square at night and people just sit on chairs placed there belonging to restaurants surrounding the square, sometimes maybe not even knowing whose chairs they are.    ZooStation - huge out of town club on the north end of Tours, free parking with a car, however to avoid getting lost on the way it is advisable to jump into a taxi and say \"Zoostation s'il vous plait\", the driver will know where you mean and will cost about €10 each way. s are pricy but the entrance fee is low, the music is mostly American and French R&B. Best enjoyed if there is a group of you as Saturday nights are busy and, like any large club, there may be some people who are out to pick a fight..  AJ du Vieux Tours 5, Rue Bretonneau, is a cheap, safe and clean hostel with no curfew. Individual, long-stay rooms are ideal for international students in Tours as the staff speak English and is a great way to make friends quickly. Has communal bathroom facilities and meals are available to buy in the cafeteria area. Also has cooking facilities for making your own meals. Great location next to a couple of internet cafés and all the bars and pubs of Place Plumereau, and just across the road from the main campus of the Université Francois-Rabelais.. Tours is a very safe city in comparison to other French cities. But if you don't speak French, you might get intimidated by homeless people asking you something in French, most likely asking for spare change or a cigarette if they see you smoking.Almost all areas in Tours are safe during the daytime. However, the quartiers to the southeast and east of the city are best avoided at night, and there are many high-rise low-rent apartment buildings. This goes double for the nearby suburb of Saint-Pierre-des-Corps, where the other major train station is located; avoid venturing too far from the station..  Angers Home of a chateau that houses the fantastic medieval Tapistries of the Apocalypse Orléans Famous through its historical association with Joan of Arc, Orleans is an interesting, cosmopolitan city Nantes A major city of the historic province of Brittany, sometimes called the Venice of the west Le Mans famous for 24 Heures du Mans, the world's oldest sports car race in endurance racing, held annually since 1923.

      "Dressed up Sámi politicians.The Sámi call their homeland (\"the Sámi land\") Sápmi (Northern Sámi), Sámeednam (Lule Sámi), Saemie (South Sámi), Säämi (Inari Sámi), Sääʹmjânnam (Skolt Sámi) or Sábmie (Ume Sámi). This land does not have a clear boundary but includes the northern part of the Scandinavian peninsula, northern Finland and the Kola peninsula. The border between Norway and Finland is more than 700 km long and runs through the Sami heartland, as does the northern section of the border between Norway and Sweden. Sápmi is largely north of the arctic circle, with a mostly subarctic climate with cold (or very cold) winters. Coastal areas have milder winters. The land is generally sparsely populated with about 2 inhabitants per square kilometre.Sami languages are Uralic languages related to Finnish and Estonian, but unrelated to Indo-European languages, such as Norwegian, Swedish, English or Russian. Sámi is not one language (although treated as one in much legislation), but a family of languages, neighbouring ones usually mutually intelligible. Sámi is an official language in Norway and within some districts equal with Norwegian, a recognised minority language in Sweden, and a co-official language in northernmost Finland. It is the only language mentioned specifically in Norway's constitution. Some Sámi languages have been written since the 1600s, although the current orthography is from the late 20th century.During the Middle Ages the Sápmi was known as Finnmǫrk in old west Norse (old Norwegian), this was not an area with clear borders and the area changed over time. A 12th century Latin description of Norway identified the coastland and the hinterland, in the latter the Sámi \"live but don't plough\" (that is, the Sámi were not farmers). From the Viking age to the Reformation, Norse settlements expanded along the coast north of Lofoten. Until about year 1400 Malangen fjord was regarded as the border between Norse-dominated area and Sami areas, even if there were non-Sami fishing posts further north and east as well as a church and fortress in Vadsø. South of Narvik the border between Norway and Sweden was largely fixed since the Middle Ages, but in the core Sami (and reindeer husbandry) areas further north there was no clear border. Sami people moved freely with their reindeer between Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia, and wide areas in the interior were regarded as \"joint districts\". The border treaty of 1751 fixed the border between Norway and Sweden/Finland once and for all. The border cut right through Sápmi and special addition to the treaty defined the rights and duties of the Sami.The Roman historian Tacitus in the first century wrote about Fenni that may also have included both Sámi and Finnish people. In the 6th century historians wrote about scritiphini that originates from Old Norse skríðfinn meaning \"skiing finns\" (finn meant Sámi at that time): For Norse people living along the coast and further south the Sámi people was associated with skiing. Noted explorer and scientist Fridtjof Nansen assumed that Sámi introduced skiing in Norway. Rock carvings in Nordland, in Alta and in northern Russia show prehistoric hunters on skis.About 30,000 people speak a Sámi language. As ethnic backgrounds are not recorded (except in Russia) and definitions vary, the exact number of Sámi are not known. Estimates range from 50,000 to 100,000 persons. The Sami parliaments in Finland, Norway and Sweden (Northern Sami: Sámediggi, Finnish: Saamelaiskäräjät, Norwegian and Swedish: Sametinget) have authority and budget primarily in cultural areas and act mainly in a consultative role in other areas.Reindeer husbandry has been – and still is – an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture surrounding the trade is important also for many with other professions. Even traditionally, though, not all Sámi have been involved in reindeer husbandry, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar, having reindeer mostly as draft animals. Today most Sámi work in modern trades and only a small minority actually work in the reindeer business. Tourism is an increasingly important income in the area.As reindeer herders or hunters, the Sámi traditionally followed the animals on their seasonal migrations, having a winter village, calving and autumn grounds, summer grounds, and mobile homes (goahtis and lávvus). As the movements between pastures took quite some time, they had eight seasons, not four. Also those living mainly from fishing moved as seasons changed. The reindeer still have seasonal pastures (mostly treeless areas in summer, either in high terrain or by the coast) but the borders between the countries closed in the 19th century, restricting the migration. With the introduction of motorized terrain vehicles (most importantly the snowmobile), reindeer herders have been able to reach their livestock from a permanent home. Some of the people you might meet were born before this revolution, and some choose to still live in or near the traditional summer settlements in summer, close to the livestock.During the 18th century the Sámi became a trendy and exotic subject to Central European adventurers and scholars. Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus travelled Arctic Scandinavia in 1732, and described the Sámi lifestyle. The linguistic relationship between Sámi language(s) and Hungarian was revealed already in 1771. Yet most of the area was connected to the road and electricity grid only after World War II.Today many tourists in Sápmi want to experience the exotic Sámi culture. This has led to non-Sámi dressing in quasi-Sámi clothes and performing \"Sámi\" rituals (thought of as insults by many Sámi). You may enjoy these shows for what they are, but if you want to learn about Sámi culture, you should be wary of the difference. On the other hand, real Sámi are, despite preserving a distinct culture and identity, to varying degrees integrated in the modern lifestyle, and marriages across the cultural borders are quite common – you should not try too hard to find \"authentic\" Sámi.Sámi people usually don't stand out among other inhabitants. Somebody wearing a full traditional dress (outside festive occasions) or a Sámi hat is most likely a non-Sámi tourism entrepreneur. The sharp-eyed may sometimes see hints on Sámi background, such as details in the clothing or a name common among the Sámi, but the best advice is probably to show appropriate interest, like you would with a presumably native New Yorker in New York, and a local just might get talkative. If you are going to pay for programme services you can of course ask about their relation to traditional Sámi lifestyle (nothing wrong in going on a husky ride, but they were introduced in Sápmi only in the 1980s, mostly by southerners).The joik is a Sámi singing style, which still is a living, continuous tradition, but also is re-interpreted today as a genre of popular music; see Nordic music.. There are quite a few airports in the Sápmi area, with at least domestic flights. Kittilä in Finland has relatively many seasonal flights from European destinations.The railways in Finland terminate at Kolari and Kemijärvi, with Rovaniemi the most important hub for continuing by coach.Swedish trains go to Kiruna, and to Narvik in Norway. Inlandsbanan is usable too.The Norwegian trains terminate at Bodø.Russian trains go to Murmansk, and with sparse services somewhat beyond.For Norway, the Hurtigruten ferry service is an option.European routes such as E6, E8, E45 and E75 reach Sápmi and can be used by those arriving by car or coach.While you need to be a passionate biker to cycle all the way to here, with long distances, lack of cycleways and harsh climate, there are Eurovelo routes to the region, such as EV 1 to Nordkapp.. Buildings in the Sámi settlement of Vastenjávrre in Padjelanta National Park.. People at the Márjjábeaivvit in Heahttá. Sámi handicraft makes good souvenirs, but check that it is authentic. In shops the item should have the Sámi duodji (literally: Sámi handicraft) mark. Typical materials are wood, leather, wool, horns and bones. Silver has been highly appreciated material in traditional Sámi jewelry.In addition to traditional handicraft, there are quite a few artists making modern jewelry with strong roots in the Sámi culture. Their products may however not be on sale locally, other than possibly from their workshop at home.Be especially wary about clothing. Sámi hats and dresses are virtually always fake, as a Sámi dress, gákti, is made for a specific person, with lots of symbolism about the home village, family and person of its user. Those who do the fakes often do not even know what details belong to a man's dress or woman's dress. However, a traditional scarf, liidni, is a prestige, commonly available, and (if authentic) quite expensive souvenir.. Crowberry or čáhppesmuorji (Empetrum nigrum subsp. hermaphroditum), one of the berries abundant even in northernmost Sápmi. The northern subspecies has somewhat bigger and sweeter berries than the subspecies found in most of Europe.As agriculture is quite a hopeless try with most crops at these latitudes, most dishes are based on reindeer, fish and game. Also some wild plants play or have traditionally played an important role, such as berries, especially cloudberry and crowberry. The Norwegian angelica (Northern Sámi: Olbmoborranrássi, Norwegian: kvann, Finnish: väinönputki) has been important vegetable and also medicinal herb. The Sámi still have their own bread types, such as flatbread called gáhkku which is traditionally baked on a stone by open fire.. As the Sámi lived semi-nomadic lives wandering between summer and winter locations they had mobile homes. The lávvu is made from straight tree stems (resembling a teepee) and thus easy to build from scratch in fell birch forest (if you have the fabric or hides to cover the structure), while the goahti is more elaborate, with larger sitting-height floor area. The lávvu stems are often left behind for next use, while the key goahti trees are carried along. There are also permanent goahtis made from timber or peat. Especially the Skolt Samis gathered into winter villages for the winter. In such villages each family had their permanent house. These mobile and stationary homes are still commonly used, both as tourist attractions and as traditional accommodation, although not as primary homes any more.Many tourist businesses invite you to drink coffee by the fire in a lávvu. Nearly always you will get more familiar lodging for the night, in a few cases with something built to resemble a lávvu, but with normal beds and mattresses.. Landscape in Käsivarsi Wilderness Area. Spots of snow remaining in July.Sápmi, the Sámi region, is mostly very sparsely populated, with a harsh or even extreme climate. Do not venture into the wilderness without proper skill and equipment.Follow instructions and take care when driving snowmobiles. Sámi drivers are usually very experienced, so watching them may make driving in the terrain seem easy. Off well-maintained routes it is not. Turning over or hitting a tree can be fatal. Also mind ice safety-.  Nenetsia with the Nenets people, an other reindeer herding people of the Arctic. Advance research is needed though, as most Nenets villages are very remote and English proficiency scarce.\n",
